					<h3>Design focus points for 2017 <small> - 1/2/2017</small></h3>
					<p class="justContent">Keeping up with design trends is essential to web development. More and more statistics show that an up-to-date responsive website leads to more searches, higher retention rate, and increased traffic. </p>
					<p>
					In 2017 I'll focus on these few points: 
					<strong>Accessibility</strong>, <strong>Responsiveness</strong>, <strong>User experience /  User flow</strong>, <strong>Page speed</strong>, and <strong>Security</strong>
					</p>
					<p class="justContent">Accessibility means allowing the web page to be accessible by everyone, whether they're on a Ipad or an older android phone. I'll focus on simpler yet intuitive web elements while following the WCAG guidelines. Responsiveness is big, so i'll focus on mobile design considerations in another post. How big? <a href="http://marketingland.com/mobile-top-sites-165725">In some content categories more than half of all traffic is mobile.</a> With User experience I'll focus on A/B testing to ensure and test new and interesting user flows. Page load speed goes hand in hand with accessibility because a more accessible website should be simpler and load quickly for everyone. I'll be using tools like <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/">Google's page speed insights. </a> My last focus will be in web application security. I need to read up more on this subject as it is one of my weaker points, but preventing attacks and securing user data is essential. Especially considering the sony / yahoo hacks are fresh in consumers minds.</p>
					<p>I'll also focusing on my pasta sauces, a roux is great for thickening white sauces but what can I incorporate to thicken my reds? 2017 will be a year of learning.</p>

					<h3>Mobile Design Points for new Developers<small> - 1/4/2017</small></h3>
					<p class="justContent">
						While working for the IEN department I got the opportunity to go through OutSystems training. While I didn't really enjoy the Outsystems application I did like the <a href="https://www.outsystems.com/learn/">free training programs they offered</a>. Here is one of the big questions they asked right off the bat.
						<h3>Why do mobile applications fail?</h3> This is big considering mobile web traffic has exceeded desktops and is rising. The big point they made in mobile application failure is <strong>UX design issues.</strong> which makes plenty of sense considering a site only 250ms slower will lead users to the competitors website. I'll hit some of the main points in their argument but check out the first few Outsystems mobile app videos for a more comprehensive approach. <h4>Incompatible UX</h4> One of the bigger ones i'd wager, because a buggy site seems sloppy and will quickly drive away a reader / potential customer. The issues could be big, like a border or gradient failing to load leaving the user with blank space. Or small, like a page size rendering incorrectly. But even the small issues are big, considering you and your team spent time (and money) to select a perfect font for the perfect situation. Also a user doesn't understand the dev process, he or she just sees a webpage that doesn't work. Immediate first thoughts could be 'sloppy' instead of 'woah nelly'. 
						<h4>Lacks consistent design</h4> This sort of goes hand-in-hand with 'm' site issues. A site that's completely different for mobile, desktop, and tablet sizes can also irritate users. Going from desktop to mobile could be confusing, a different feeling could be invoked for each different design, and the company branding could be less powerful. <h4>Poor strategy</h4> A mobile website can send a powerful message about the company if done correctly. A site needs to be quick for mobile and tablet users, this can be done by keeping it simple. Not only do you have to take mobile processors speed into account but also internet, which varies depending on service provider. An app must recognize its target and appeal to it. It's easy to get caught up in design and forget the target audience. An app would also benefit from having the right amount of features, too little or too less greatly affects UX. Do some testing, find out what features people are actually using, and which ones are missing their mark. Lastly a designer needs to remember mobile apps are inherently "interruptible". Info will benefit from being broken up into sections, so their readers can easily skim while holding their lattes and walking to work etc. Try and assume the reader has an extremely short attention span, using a 6 second rule for each section of content helps.

    			On a personal level I love music. Lots of people will say 'I like all types of music' but they've never gone from 70's soft rock love songs to modern ska to disco tunes and back in one sitting. I'm passionate about the environment ever since my freshman environmental biology course. My proffessor made it a point to show us how much we consume, how much we throw away, and how it's ruining the planet. But I also love good design on the internet and see it as a way to spred information and correct misinformation. But a point can be so much more powerful if formatted correctly.

    		<h3>About my work</h3>
    		<p class="justContent">
    			Hello, my name's Ethan Bellora and I'm a professional front end developer. While my focus is in front end design techniques I have knowledge of back end and RESTful services. I'm extremely passionate about learning and sharing everything I learn in the process. I believe perfecting a front end language is essential but what makes a good dev great is all in the details of design. You can be amazing at positioning elements and JS animations but if you don't know when to use them correctly you'll miss your mark. While I don't have a ton of experience at the moment I'm always working on projects in tandum with my studies. I hope to make a few of my projects a success while I search for a development community to call home. I take courses at Udemy for my education and have studied Jon Ducketts <i>Javascript & JQuery</i>. Please visit my <a href="https://stackshare.io/Ethanb75">stackshare</a> to see some of the tools I like to employ, I would love the view!</p>
    		<p><STRONG>Some concepts I beleive are tried and true:</STRONG></p>
    		<ul>
    			<li>Atomic Design</li>
    			<li>The Pomodoro technique</li>
    			<li>Balancing good UX and design</li>
    			<li>Practicality over design</li>
    			<li>Component-based JS front-end</li>
    			<li>Writing good tested code over rushed buggy code</li>
    			<li>Minimalism</li>
